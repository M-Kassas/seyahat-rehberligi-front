It was the capital city of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in the 10th century AD. Ani was situated on trade routes and grew to become a walled city of more than 100,000 residents by the 11th century. In the centuries that followed, Ani and the surrounding region were conquered by Byzantine emperors, Ottoman Turks, Georgians, and Russians who laid claim to the area, repeatedly attacking, and chasing out the residents. By AD 1300, Ani was in steep decline and by 1700, it was completely abandoned. Today, most of the churches are still standing to a sufficient height, and the streets, baths, an early mosque, and the great fortification walls are impressive. Thanks to its geographical location, the settlement in Ani has survived for almost 2,500 years. This city that was once one of the cultural, political, and commercial centers on the Silk Road, displays architecture that combines a variety of domestic, religious, and military structures, creating a vision of medieval urbanism built up over the centuries by successive Christian and Muslim dynasties."

Before Göbeklitepe, the history of the Neolithic period began around 9000 BC; the colossal statues and several of the reliefs on the statues are truly unique for this period. Considering the absence of metal tools, it is remarkable to consider that the statues were made using exclusively stone tools. Nothing similar from this period has ever been found. It is understood that Göbeklitepe was a kind of shrine, consisting of round rooms, each containing these colossal statues. According to scholars, this is a cult area where ancestral cult rituals were performed that were connected to death and the underworld. There are no ceramics or signs of any settlement here; however, the giant project that was carried out at Göbeklitepe points to a very sophisticated and organized society in close vicinity. Surprisingly, the Göbeklitepe shrines were not buried by natural causes, but on purpose by people who once lived here - the reason remains a mystery. Recent surveys in the area have revealed the presence of several other similar shrines/structures from the same period."

The Mausoleum of Hecatomnus had been defined in various studies as a “temple,” but recent research has revealed that it is a monumental tomb. With regard to its architectural features, it is possible to date the tomb to the early 4th century BC. Considering the burial customs of the period when Hecatomnus was a satrap and considering that Mylasa was the capital of Caria at the time, the tomb most certainly belongs to Hecatomnus and his family. In addition, the low reliefs on the sarcophagus and the iconography of the wall paintings support the argument that this mausoleum belonged to Hecatomnus. The mausoleum and sacred area of Hecatomnus include a temenos; the Menandros (Menander) Column, a monumental column dedicated to Menander which once probably had a statue of him on top; a podium; and the mausoleum which consists of a load-bearing room (to lessen the load of the burial room), a burial room, a sarcophagus, and a dromos, the entrance passage leading to the tomb.

The strait has always been of great strategic and economic importance as the gateway to İstanbul and the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. “The Winds Brought Wealth to Troia”.  Indeed, the strong northern winds of this area, made it a challenge to cross the Dardanelles, and the lower countercurrent under the Dardanelles made it even worse. Sailors discovered that placing a deep net under the boat allowed them to catch this countercurrent and cross the strait. In any case, boats had to wait in the harbors of Troy, and as it was right on the crossroads, trade made the city extremely wealthy. Prosperity gave rise to cultural wealth, and excavations have confirmed a wealth comparable to that described in the Iliad."

The Entente Powers or the Allies of World War I, Britain, France, and Russia, sought to weaken the Ottoman Empire by taking control of the Turkish Straits. This would expose the Ottoman capital Constantinople (modern-day İstanbul) to bombardment by the Allies’ battleships and would cut it off from the Asian part of the empire. With the Ottoman Empire defeated, the Suez Canal would be safe, and a year-round supply route could be opened through the Black Sea to ports in Russia. The Allied fleet's attempt to force the Dardanelles in February 1915 failed and was followed by an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in April 1915. In January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned, and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a horrible defeat for the sponsors, especially Winston Churchill, while the campaign was considered a great Ottoman victory. In Türkiye, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defense of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Türkiye eight years later, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli, as founder and president. The battlefields are now a national park; together with the war graves, numerous monuments, and war-related artifacts, they are registered as “historical sites and objects.”"

The ancient city is situated on a rocky hill, on the territory of modern Turkish village of Behramkale, 17 kilometers south of the district of Ayvacık in the province of Çanakkale. The site offers a beautiful view of the island of Lesbos. Archaeological evidence shows that the area was inhabited as early as the Bronze Age. The 4th century BC was a period of great prosperity for Assos when Hermias of Atarneus, a student and later father-in-law of Plato, ruled the city, as well as the rest of the Troad (today’s Biga Peninsula) and Lesbos. In 348 BC, Aristotle came to Assos and established a philosophical school where he taught for three years. The city can be visited in two parts: the acropolis and the lower city. The acropolis hosts the earliest Doric temple in Anatolia, a Temple of Athena, fortification walls, and a Turkish mosque from the early period. You can follow the path down to the lower city and visit the agora, the bouleuterion, the gymnasium, and enjoy the great view of Lesbos from the theater."

Being an important caravan station on the main East–West trade route, the city became the financial center of the area. Safranbolu consists of three historic areas: the marketplace area of the inner city, known as Çukur; the area of Kıranköy; and Bağlar, the Vineyards. Çukur is located in the lower part of the town as the name Çukur (pit) suggests and is surrounded by two rivers. The marketplace is surrounded by traditional houses and the workshops of craftsmen. The city center represents a typical Anatolian town center, a çarşı (bazaar, open market area). Kıranköy used to be a non-Muslim district and in the typical architectural style of the time, artisans and tradesmen lived above their shops. The houses here were built using stone, while the houses in Çukur were wooden."

The site of the ancient city with the ruins of temples and palaces, the monumental sculptures, and the enormous fortification walls with ceremonial gates and tunnels attests to the fact that this was once the home of a great empire. Much has been learned about the religion of the empire’s people by studying the line of gods and goddesses carved on the walls of the open-air rock sanctuary at Yazilikaya. The relief of the Hittite pantheon constitutes one of the best examples of Hittite monumental relief sculpture in situ. The excavations have revealed that the area was inhabited as early as the 5th millennium. The thousands of Hittite tablets that came to light changed what was known about this period of time. When the Hittite texts were first deciphered, scientists realized that they belonged to an important empire of the 2nd millennium which had been unknown up until then - an empire that could compete with the Egyptian and Assyro-Babylonian kingdoms. The Hittites dominated the 2nd millennium, went as far as Kadesh (Syria), and confronted the Egyptians there. As a result, the first written peace treaty of the world appeared between the Hittites and the Egyptians. Another interesting revelation was that almost all of the Hittite gods are earlier versions of the Greek gods. For instance, the weather god Teshup became the Greek god Zeus and Teshup’s consort Hebat (or Hepatu) became the later Hera. The Hittite texts also offered points of reference for the Egyptian texts. The city seems to have flourished especially during the 14th and 13th centuries BC, and most of the monumental buildings we see today are from this period. Like Troy, and almost all Bronze Age settlements of Anatolia, Hattusa was abandoned and never recovered its prosperity after the 12th century BC."

An empire that could compete with Egypt and Assyro Babylonian kingdoms. The Hittites dominated the 2nd millennium, went as far as Kadesh, and confront the Egyptians here. As a result, the first written peace treaty of the world appeared between the Hittites and the Egyptians. It was also interesting to see the Hittite version of almost all the Greek Gods, for instance, Teshup became Zeus, Hepatu became Hera. The Hittite texts also enabled us to re confirm the Egyptian texts. The city seems to flourish especially during the 14th and 13th centuries BCE, and most of the monumental buildings we see today are from this period. Like Troia, and almost all Bronze Age Settlements of Anatolia, Hattusa also was abandoned and never recovered again after 12thy century BCE."
