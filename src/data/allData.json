The people of Termessos in fact noted, “We are neither Pisidian nor Lycians, but we are Solymians” referring to their sacred mountain and to the main deity of the city, Zeus Solymeus. Alexander the Great failed to capture the city in AD 333, likening it to an eagle’s nest. Alexander did not even attempt to lay siege to it, preferring instead to march on. The historian Arrian of Nicomedia discussed how even a small force could defend Termessos due to its excellent natural fortifications. Since until recently there were no modern settlements or roads leading up the city, most buildings are, for the most part, intact and give visitors a strong sense of walking back in time."

It was the capital city of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in the 10th century AD. Ani was situated on trade routes and grew to become a walled city of more than 100,000 residents by the 11th century. In the centuries that followed, Ani and the surrounding region were conquered by Byzantine emperors, Ottoman Turks, Georgians, and Russians who laid claim to the area, repeatedly attacking, and chasing out the residents. By AD 1300, Ani was in steep decline and by 1700, it was completely abandoned. Today, most of the churches are still standing to a sufficient height, and the streets, baths, an early mosque, and the great fortification walls are impressive. Thanks to its geographical location, the settlement in Ani has survived for almost 2,500 years. This city that was once one of the cultural, political, and commercial centers on the Silk Road, displays architecture that combines a variety of domestic, religious, and military structures, creating a vision of medieval urbanism built up over the centuries by successive Christian and Muslim dynasties."

Before Göbeklitepe, the history of the Neolithic period began around 9000 BC; the colossal statues and several of the reliefs on the statues are truly unique for this period. Considering the absence of metal tools, it is remarkable to consider that the statues were made using exclusively stone tools. Nothing similar from this period has ever been found. It is understood that Göbeklitepe was a kind of shrine, consisting of round rooms, each containing these colossal statues. According to scholars, this is a cult area where ancestral cult rituals were performed that were connected to death and the underworld. There are no ceramics or signs of any settlement here; however, the giant project that was carried out at Göbeklitepe points to a very sophisticated and organized society in close vicinity. Surprisingly, the Göbeklitepe shrines were not buried by natural causes, but on purpose by people who once lived here - the reason remains a mystery. Recent surveys in the area have revealed the presence of several other similar shrines/structures from the same period."

Hecatomnus of Mylasa (today’s Milas) was the father of the famous Mausolus, whose wife Artemisia built the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, a monumental shrine in his honor that became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. The Mausoleum of Hecatomnus had been defined in various studies as a “temple,” but recent research has revealed that it is a monumental tomb. With regard to its architectural features, it is possible to date the tomb to the early 4th century BC. Considering the burial customs of the period when Hecatomnus was a satrap and considering that Mylasa was the capital of Caria at the time, the tomb most certainly belongs to Hecatomnus and his family. In addition, the low reliefs on the sarcophagus and the iconography of the wall paintings support the argument that this mausoleum belonged to Hecatomnus. The mausoleum and sacred area of Hecatomnus include a temenos; the Menandros (Menander) Column, a monumental column dedicated to Menander which once probably had a statue of him on top; a podium; and the mausoleum which consists of a load-bearing room (to lessen the load of the burial room), a burial room, a sarcophagus, and a dromos, the entrance passage leading to the tomb.

Indeed, Xanthos was the capital city of Lycia in the early Lycian times. The city’s residents committed mass suicide at least two times in the city’s history instead of surrendering to the enemy. The first time was in 546 BC, during the Persian invasion, and the second time was in the 1st century BC when Brutus came to Lycia to gather forces. Ruins from the city’s days of glory can be found throughout the city. In a typical Lycian tradition, the city center is decorated with beautiful Lycian tombs, most of them with reliefs and inscriptions both in the Lycian language, an Indo-European language, and Greek. Unfortunately, a lot of antiquities were removed from Xanthos in the 19th century when Sir Charles Fellows came to Lycia and shipped dozens of boxes full of Lycian art back to England. These antiquities today are displayed at the British Museum in London."

In 480 BC, the Persian army of Xerxes I crossed the strait on a pontoon bridge, and Alexander the Great did the same in 334 BC on his expedition against Persia. The strait has always been of great strategic and economic importance as the gateway to İstanbul and the Black Sea from the Mediterranean. “The Winds Brought Wealth to Troia”.  Indeed, the strong northern winds of this area, made it a challenge to cross the Dardanelles, and the lower countercurrent under the Dardanelles made it even worse. Sailors discovered that placing a deep net under the boat allowed them to catch this countercurrent and cross the strait. In any case, boats had to wait in the harbors of Troy, and as it was right on the crossroads, trade made the city extremely wealthy. Prosperity gave rise to cultural wealth, and excavations have confirmed a wealth comparable to that described in the Iliad."

In Türkiye, the battle is known as the “Battle of Çanakkale” and in the West it is known as the “Gallipoli Campaign.” The Gallipoli Campaign took place on the Gallipoli Peninsula, between February 17, 1915 and January 9, 1916. The Entente Powers or the Allies of World War I, Britain, France, and Russia, sought to weaken the Ottoman Empire by taking control of the Turkish Straits. This would expose the Ottoman capital Constantinople (modern-day İstanbul) to bombardment by the Allies’ battleships and would cut it off from the Asian part of the empire. With the Ottoman Empire defeated, the Suez Canal would be safe, and a year-round supply route could be opened through the Black Sea to ports in Russia. The Allied fleet's attempt to force the Dardanelles in February 1915 failed and was followed by an amphibious landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula in April 1915. In January 1916, after eight months' fighting, with approximately 250,000 casualties on each side, the land campaign was abandoned, and the invasion force withdrawn. It was a horrible defeat for the sponsors, especially Winston Churchill, while the campaign was considered a great Ottoman victory. In Türkiye, it is regarded as a defining moment in the history of the state, a final surge in the defense of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire retreated. The struggle formed the basis for the Turkish War of Independence and the declaration of the Republic of Türkiye eight years later, with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli, as founder and president. The battlefields are now a national park; together with the war graves, numerous monuments, and war-related artifacts, they are registered as “historical sites and objects.”"

The 4th century BC was a period of great prosperity for Assos when Hermias of Atarneus, a student and later father-in-law of Plato, ruled the city, as well as the rest of the Troad (today’s Biga Peninsula) and Lesbos. In 348 BC, Aristotle came to Assos and established a philosophical school where he taught for three years. The city can be visited in two parts: the acropolis and the lower city. The acropolis hosts the earliest Doric temple in Anatolia, a Temple of Athena, fortification walls, and a Turkish mosque from the early period.

The city center represents a typical Anatolian town center, a çarşı (bazaar, open market area).

The site of the ancient city with the ruins of temples and palaces, the monumental sculptures, and the enormous fortification walls with ceremonial gates and tunnels attests to the fact that this was once the home of a great empire. Much has been learned about the religion of the empire’s people by studying the line of gods and goddesses carved on the walls of the open-air rock sanctuary at Yazilikaya. The relief of the Hittite pantheon constitutes one of the best examples of Hittite monumental relief sculpture in situ. The excavations have revealed that the area was inhabited as early as the 5th millennium. The thousands of Hittite tablets that came to light changed what was known about this period of time. When the Hittite texts were first deciphered, scientists realized that they belonged to an important empire of the 2nd millennium which had been unknown up until then - an empire that could compete with the Egyptian and Assyro-Babylonian kingdoms. The Hittites dominated the 2nd millennium, went as far as Kadesh (Syria), and confronted the Egyptians there. As a result, the first written peace treaty of the world appeared between the Hittites and the Egyptians. Another interesting revelation was that almost all of the Hittite gods are earlier versions of the Greek gods. For instance, the weather god Teshup became the Greek god Zeus and Teshup’s consort Hebat (or Hepatu) became the later Hera. The Hittite texts also offered points of reference for the Egyptian texts. The city seems to have flourished especially during the 14th and 13th centuries BC, and most of the monumental buildings we see today are from this period. Like Troy, and almost all Bronze Age settlements of Anatolia, Hattusa was abandoned and never recovered its prosperity after the 12th century BC."

Archaeological evidence shows that the area was inhabited as early as the Bronze Age and the “ss” in its name suggests the Anatolian Origin of the city. In the 4th century BCE was a period of great prosperity for Assos when Hermeias, a student of Plato, ruled the city, as well as the rest of the Troad peninsula. In 348 BCE Aristotle came to Assos and established a philosophical school where he taught for three years. The city can be visited in two parts, the acropolis, and the lower city. Acropolis hosts the earliest Doric Temple in Anatolia, the temple of Athena, the fortification walls, and a Turkish Mosque from the early period. You can follow the path down to the lower city and visit the agora, bouleuterion, gymnasion, and enjoy the great view of Lesbos from the theater.

Parion, which became a city inhabited by the Christians starting from the 5th century CE is understood to be an important Bishopric centre of the Byzantine Period due to the presence of various priests who were sent here.  An important detail related to the Christianity Period of the city is that it became the Archbishopric Center of the Empire at the time of the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogennetos in the 10th century CE."

The site of the ancient city with the ruins of its temples and palaces, monumental sculptures and the enormous fortification walls with ceremonial gates and tunnels attest to the fact that this was once the home of a great imperial people.  Much has been learned about the religion of these people by studying the line of gods and goddesses carved on the walls of the open-air rock sanctuary at Yazılıkaya. The relief of the Hittite pantheon constitutes one of the best exhibitions of Hittite monumental relief carvings in situ. The excavations showed that the area was inhabited as early as the 5th millennium, and the thousands of Hittite tablets changed the known ancient history. When the Hittite texts were first deciphered, scientists realized that these belong to an important empire of the 2nd millennium that was not known before. An empire that could compete with Egypt and Assyro Babylonian kingdoms. The Hittites dominated the 2nd millennium, went as far as Kadesh, and confront the Egyptians here. As a result, the first written peace treaty of the world appeared between the Hittites and the Egyptians. It was also interesting to see the Hittite version of almost all the Greek Gods, for instance, Teshup became Zeus, Hepatu became Hera. The Hittite texts also enabled us to re confirm the Egyptian texts. The city seems to flourish especially during the 14th and 13th centuries BCE, and most of the monumental buildings we see today are from this period. Like Troia, and almost all Bronze Age Settlements of Anatolia, Hattusa also was abandoned and never recovered again after 12thy century BCE."

There are multiple round structures in Göbeklitepe, which are not used as a settlement area, but served only for ritual purposes. These structures, 6 of which have been unearthed until today, rise on T-shaped pillars up to 6 meters in height with similar shapes.

Balıklıgöl is Şanlıurfa’s coolest, greenest and biggest wetland in the region. It also has a mystical and spiritual atmosphere. The fish in the Halil-ur Rahman Lake are considered sacred, respected by the people and cannot be eaten. According to narrations, Prophet Ibrahim’s mother had to hide in a cave near the lake to give birth to him, because the cruel ruler Nimrod slaughtered baby boys by sword. Afterwards, Prophet Ibrahim was fed and raised sometimes by his mother and sometimes by gazelles. When Prophet Ibrahim started to teach the monotheistic belief, he entered into a tough struggle with the Nimrod and the pagans. And when he destroyed the idols in the temple, Nimrod wanted to burn him on a large pile of wood as an exemplary punishment. The moment Prophet Ibrahim was set on fire, the fire turned into a clear pool. The burning wood turned into fish. This is why we call this lake Balıklıgöl today, and why the fish are considered sacred. Upon this, Zeliha, the daughter of Nimrod also believed in the God of Prophet Ibrahim.  Thus, Nimrod also threw his daughter to the fire. For this reason, the small pond right next to Balıklıgöl is popularly known as Ayn-ı Zeliha."

Fabrics woven on hand looms are colored with natural dyes obtained from quince seeds, pomegranate peel, walnut leaves and acorns and root dyes. A traditional weaving type unique to Buldan, “Buldan crepe” Buldan cloth is also known by names such as twisted cloth, white banner cloth. Buldan cloth, which is a simple and robust weaving product, gains a unique wrinkled structure by using very twisted yarns. The wrinkled texture is caused by washingthe plain fabric in hot soapy water. Due to this unique structure of Buldan cloth and fabric, it creates an air gap between the body and the clothing and functions as heat insulation.
